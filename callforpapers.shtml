                <h3>BEST PAPER AWARDS:</h3>
                <p>SBP 13 will feature a Best Paper Award and a Best Student Paper Award.  All papers are qualified for the Best Paper Award. Papers where the senior author says the principal author is a student will be considered for the Best Student Paper Award.

                <h2>ABOUT SBP:</h2>
                <p>SBP is a multidisciplinary conference with a selective single paper track and poster session. SBP also invites a small number of high quality tutorials and nationally recognized keynote speakers. 

                <p>Social computing harnesses the power of computational methods to study social behavior within a social context. Cultural behavioral modeling refers to representing behavior and culture in the abstract, and is a convenient and powerful way to conduct virtual experiments and scenario analysis. Both social computing and cultural behavioral modeling are techniques designed to achieve a better understanding of complex behaviors, patterns, and associated outcomes of interest. Moreover, these approaches are inherently interdisciplinary; subsystems and system components exist at multiple levels of analysis (i.e., “cells to societies”) and across multiple disciplines, from engineering and the computational sciences to the social and health sciences. </p>

                <p>The SBP conference provides a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government agencies to exchange ideas on current challenges in social computing, behavioral modeling and prediction, and on state-of-the-art methods and best practices being adopted to tackle these challenges.</p>
