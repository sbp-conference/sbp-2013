                                <blockquote>Bernardo Huberman is a Senior HP Fellow and Director of the Social Computing Lab at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories. Trained as a physicist, Dr Huberman has made an impact in a wide variety of areas. In the field of information sciences, he predicted the existence of phase transitions in large scale distributed systems, and developed an economics approach to the solution of hard computational problems. Dr. Huberman is one of the creators of the field of ecology of computation, and editor of a book on the subject. He published the book: “The Laws of the Web: Patterns in the Ecology of Information”, with MIT Press in 2001.Presently, his work centers on the design of novel mechanisms for discovering and aggregating information in distributed systems as well as understanding the dynamics of information in large networks.
